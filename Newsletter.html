            Social networks: the 5 most common dangers and which actions to take

            If social media is used in a clueless way, this can have emotional,
            social, financial, and even legal consequences. In some cases, it
            can even lead to personal data being shared. Children and teenagers
            are especially exposed to the social media risks, but this doesn’t
            mean that adults, authorities, banks, and even large internet
            companies are not immune. Social networks are more important than
            ever. From the approximate 3.43 billion internet users worldwide,
            2.28 billion (almost a third of the world’s population) regularly
            visits social networks – and the trend is rising. As the platform
            with the most monthly clicks, Facebook is leading the way and is
            even celebrating a double victory among mobile device users with its
            partner, WhatsApp. The enthusiasm for sharing sloth and cat photos
            may be great, but where there’s more people, it makes it easier for
            tricksters to lurk. In real life, they are attracted by street
            festivals, crowded train carriages, and bustling tourist
            attractions; in the digital world, it’s social networks that are
            flashing beacons for hackers and cyber criminals.

            Social networks as a PR tool: poor organization jeopardizes your
            image

            Many companies use social networks to increase their reach and
            communicate with customers. However, large institutions or companies
            often have a large number of accounts that need to be managed. If
            there is no leading position that takes care of how accurate and how
            up-to-date topics are, this quickly makes a bad impression on
            readers. This lack of content organization is one of the social
            media dangers that many companies underestimate. The comment column
            should never be left unmoderated: a discussion full of insults will
            deter new readers. If the company doesn’t intervene, this could also
            damage their image. Scandals are inevitable and could lead to a PR
            nightmare. Businesses should offer courses as well as implement a
            social media policy. It’s also a good idea to have restricted access
            for certain employees. These can help you secure a successful online
            presence, but legal protection is also important. One of the biggest
            threats in social networks is hackers, who either falsify content or
            distribute viruses and worms to customers after they’ve taken over
            an unsuspecting victim’s account. Phishing and redirecting users to
            malicious websites is also on the rise among cybercriminals.
            Depending on the type of attack, financial damage can occur in
            addition to reputational damage.

            Change the privacy of your posts and profiles.  It may take a bit of research, but there will be some level of configuration available that allows you to restrict the visibility of your posts.  Some sites allow a great deal of control over who can see your information, while others do not.

Be careful about what you make visible to your network, but especially what you make public.  You shouldn’t make the name of your high school, your birthdate, your address, your children’s or pets’ names, or other personal information public.  Many times, this information is used by scammers to pretend to be someone you know, or by hackers trying to force password resets on accounts.  And, while it may be obvious, do not post social security numbers, credit card numbers, account numbers or other types of confidential/financial information.

            with professional usage, including inconsistent personal branding,
            being viewed as someone who’s slow to adopt social media, damage to
            personal reputation and leaked data that poses security risks. The
            following technology-based risks are also concerning: Hacks Service
            interruptions Unintentional or intentional violation of legal

            the mark due to visible and vocal minority
